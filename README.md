This repository contains notebooks for the Kaggle beginner competition 'House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques.' `walkthrough.ipynb` is heavily inspired by a YouTube walkthrough by Ryan Nolan, though I made adjustments to his work in order to try and improve his models. The training and testing data are uploaded as `train.csv` and  `test.csv` respectively.
